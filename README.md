# Krawlet

The (nearly) fully-featured Kromer wallet, built in Svelte!

## Features

The web interface is the primary means to interact with Krawlet.
The web interface features:

- Viewing Kromer transactions and their metadata
- Viewing addresses, including their transactions and names purchased
- Listing addresses (including by the richest)
- Sending Kromer to addresses or online Minecraft players when provided a private key
- "Fill-ins" for known Minecraft addresses or verified addresses, making it easier to identify who is involved in transactions and other actions

In addition to the web interface, Krawlet also includes several chat-based commands that can be used. These include:

- `\balance [player]` - View another players (or your own) Kromer balance
- `\richest [page]` - View the richest addresses on Kromer
- `\names [page]` - View names registered on Kromer

To view an updated list of commands offered by Krawlet, use `\krawlet` in chat!

Krawlet is still in active development, so more features will be added soon!
